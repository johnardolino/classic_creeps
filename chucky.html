				<p class="monster_p"><strong>Chucky</strong> is the evil doll from the 1988 American slasher film <strong>Child's Play</strong> directed and co-written by Tom Holland, and produced by David Kirschner from a story by Don Mancini. It is the first film in the Child's Play series and the first installment to feature the character Chucky. It stars Catherine Hicks, Dinah Manoff, Chris Sarandon, Alex Vincent, and Brad Dourif. Hicks plays a widowed mother who gives her son a doll for his birthday, unaware that the doll is possessed by the soul of an infamous serial killer.</p>
				<p class="monster_p">The film was released on November 9, 1988, and grossed more than $44 million against a production budget of $9 million. Along with the film gaining a cult following,[4] the box office success spawned a series of six sequels, along with merchandise and comic books. Child's Play was the only film in the series to be distributed by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, as the rights to the series were sold to Universal Pictures in 1990, right before production on Child's Play 2 started.</p>
				<p class="monster_p"><b><u>Plot:</u></b></p> 
				<p class="monster_p">On the night of November 9, 1988, serial killer and fugitive Charles Lee Ray is seen running through the streets of South Side, Chicago. Charles is chased down by homicide detective Mike Norris who shoots him several times, but still manages to make it to his getaway vehicle. However, he is left behind after his accomplice, Eddie Caputo, gets scared and drives away without him. Charles then enters a toy shop, where he is fatally shot by Norris. Realizing that he is soon going to die, he transfers his soul into a "Good Guys" doll via a Haitian Vodou spell. A bolt of lightning causes the shop to explode. Mike survives the explosion and enters the shop, only to find Charles' dead body and all the "Good Guys" dolls on the floor.</p>

				<p class="monster_p">The next day, widow Karen Barclay unknowingly purchases the doll Charles transferred his soul into (now known as Chucky) from a peddler, as a birthday gift for her six-year-old son Andy Barclay. Later that evening, Karen's friend Maggie Peterson babysits Andy. After putting Andy to bed, Maggie is hit in the face with a hammer and falls out the window to her death. The police search the apartment. Detective Norris deems Andy a suspect, much to the annoyance of Karen, who orders Mike and the police to leave once they complete their investigation.</p> 
				<p class="monster_p">The next morning, Chucky orders Andy to skip school and take the Chicago "L" downtown. While Andy is urinating, Chucky sneaks into Eddie's lair, turning off a stove's pilot light but turning up the gas. As Eddie shoots the stove, the house blows up, killing him. Andy, once again a suspect, is placed in a psychiatric hospital. That night, Karen goes home with the Chucky doll. Karen takes the box Chucky came in to look at it, a pack of batteries fall out, and reads the bottom of the “Good Guy doll” logo saying “Batteries included”, revealing that Chucky’s batteries were never inserted and that he has been functioning without batteries. She then looks at its back and opens the lid which appears to be no batteries at all. Chucky’s head then spins at Karen saying one of its phrases and Karen fearfully drops him. Karen picks Chucky back up where she tries to get him to talk which he doesn’t. She then turns on the fire set and threatens to throw him in. Angered, Chucky springs to life, and starts attacking Karen including biting her arm. Chucky then escapes. She tries to chase Chucky as he flees but is too late. Karen finds Mike at the station and alerts Mike about the fact that Andy really was telling the truth but shows him the bite wound that Chucky made. He does not believe her and leaves. As Mike drives home, Chucky appears in the backside and tries to strangle Mike from the backseat using a cord but Mike burn Chucky’s cheek with a car cigarette lighter. After that, Chucky attempts to stab Mike by stabbing holes through the back and cushion of his seat which Mike avoids each one. Mike, struggling to drive while Chucky tries to kill him, accidentally hits a dumpster, flipping the car upside down which Chucky and Mike both survive. Mike shoots Chucky and he leaves. After that, Mike finally believes Karen and decides to help her.</p>
				<p class="monster_p">Chucky goes to John Bishop who taught him the chant. John tells him that the longer he stays in the doll, the more human he will become. Ignoring Chucky's pleas for help, John attempts to make a call. Chucky tortures John, breaking John's leg and arm with a voodoo doll of him, forcing John to tell him that he has to transfer his soul to the first person who he revealed his true identity to which is Andy. Chucky then stabs the doll in the chest, affecting John. Chucky escapes just before Karen and Mike arrive on the scene. Before bleeding out and dying, John tells them that although Chucky is a doll, he has a heart as well and his heart is fully human and vulnerable to fatal injury and that only way to kill him is to strike him in the heart.</p>

				<p class="monster_p">At the mental hospital, Chucky steals the key to Andy's cell, but Andy is able to trick Chucky with pillows under the bed sheets and escape his cell. Dr. Ardmore finds Andy in the surgery room and attempts to subdue him. Chucky stabs Dr. Ardmore in the leg with a surgery blade and shocks him to death with an Electroconvulsive therapy head set. He chases Andy home, knocking him unconscious with a baseball bat. Chucky then begins possessing Andy. Karen and Mike arrive and stop him before Chucky's soul is transferred. Chucky slashes Mike, then goes after Karen and Andy. Soon, the pair trap Chucky in the fireplace and burn him alive. Karen and Andy leave the room to help Mike, but a heavily burned Chucky follows them and attempts to kill them, since burning him alive didn't work. Chucky is again thought to be killed when Karen shoots off his head, arm, and leg. Mike's partner Jack Santos arrives at the apartment, and disbelieves the trio's story just before Chucky's body then bursts through a ventilation duct and tries to strangle Jack with his remaining arm. During the struggle, Karen tells Mike to aim and shoot at Chucky's heart like John said at his last words which Mike does finally killing him. While Mike, Jack and Karen go to the hospital, Karen turns off the bedroom's lights and Andy looks back at Chucky's burned doll corpse remains before closing the door. (End of Plot)</p>
				<p class="monster_p">Child's Play was filmed in Chicago, Illinois for on-location scenes. The Chicago landmark the Brewster Apartments, located at Diversey and Pine Grove, served as the location of the apartment where Andy and Karen lived and is pictured on the film's poster. In-studio filming took place at Culver Studios in Culver City, California. David Kirschner produced all six films in the Chucky series.</p>

				<p class="monster_p">During an airing of the movie on the morning of January 7, 2007, AMC claimed the creator modeled the doll after the Cabbage Patch Kids. This was confirmed by an interview with the creator, Don Mancini, which was featured on the Seed of Chucky DVD. Holland, on the other hand, affirms that My Buddy dolls played a role in Chucky's design. Don Mancini stated his original script was a whodunit story which dealt with the effect of advertising/television on children. Mancini's original script was written to toy with the audience a bit longer, making them wonder whether young Andy was the killer rather than Chucky.</p>
				<p class="monster_p">The film used various ways to portray Chucky, including RC animatronics and little people or child actors. Various animatronics and cosmetics were used for every scene. Throughout the movie, Chucky's cosmetics transition from looking toy-like to a more human look. The film created multiple Chucky animatronics such as a flailing tantrum Chucky, a walking Chucky, and a stationary Chucky. The animatronic's face was controlled via remote control through a rig that goes on one's face and captures facial movement.</p>
