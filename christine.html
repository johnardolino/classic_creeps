				<p class="monster_p"><strong>Christine</strong> is a 1983 American psychological horror film directed by John Carpenter and starring Keith Gordon, John Stockwell, Alexandra Paul, Robert Prosky and Harry Dean Stanton. The film also features supporting performances from Roberts Blossom and Kelly Preston. Written by Bill Phillips and based on Stephen King’s 1983 novel of the same name, the plot follows a sentient and violent vintage Plymouth Fury named Christine, and its effects on the car's new teenage owner.</p>
				<p class="monster_p">Upon its release, the film grossed $21 million at the US box office. Despite a lukewarm reception among critics, the film has become a cult classic.</p>
				<p class="monster_p"><b><u>Plot:</u></b></p> 
				<p class="monster_p">In Detroit, Michigan September 1957, at a Chrysler Corporation assembly plant, a line worker props open the hood of a newly assembled 1958 Plymouth Fury, rests his hand in front of the radiator and bends down to inspect the front end. Without warning, the hood slams down on the worker's hand. As he is taken for medical attention, another worker who is smoking a cigar, sits behind the wheel. Whilst smoking his cigar, he drops a large piece of ash on the passenger seat. There is a cut to the end of the shift, everyone leaves but the line supervisor notices the worker still slumped in the car seat. When he opens the door, the worker falls out - dead with a look of terror on his face.</p>

				<p class="monster_p">21 years later, in September 1978, Arnold "Arnie" Cunningham is an awkward and unpopular teenager, in Rockbridge, California, with only one friend, Dennis Guilder. Arnie's life begins to change when he buys a used, badly battered red-and-white 1958 Plymouth Fury named "Christine" (the same car from the assembly plant), in need of extensive repairs. Due to his parents being against him keeping the car in their yard, Arnie begins to restore Christine at Darnell's Autobody, a local repair shop and junkyard, but as he spends more of his time working on the car, he discards his glasses, dresses more like a 1950s greaser, and develops an arrogant personality. Dennis investigates and learns of the car's dark past, that its obsessive previous owner and his wife both died in it, and their daughter choked to death inside the car; but Arnie does not know this. Arnie's new girlfriend, Leigh Cabot, narrowly escapes death when she chokes on a hamburger inside the car while on a date with Arnie.</p> 
				<p class="monster_p">Angry with Arnie after a shop class confrontation leads to his expulsion, school bully Buddy Repperton and his gang vandalize Christine. Arnie is devastated and determined to repair Christine. As he examines the ruined car, he hears the creaking of metal and notices the engine is now fully restored. Arnie tells the car: "Show me." Christine shines its headlights and restores itself to showroom quality, then, driving itself, seeks out the vandals. Moochie Welch is targeted first and chased down by Christine into an alley and is crushed to death. Richie and Don are caught in a gas station explosion (which sets Christine on fire); and Buddy is chased down a road until he is run over and burned to death by the flaming car. Darnell, owner of the garage and junkyard where Arnie restored and keeps his Plymouth Fury, is murdered by Christine in the garage when he sits in the car and is crushed between the seat and the steering wheel. Rumors begin to spread about Arnie and the car, as state policeman Rudolph Junkins becomes suspicious of Arnie.</p>

				<p class="monster_p">On New Year's Eve, Dennis and Leigh decide that the only way to stop Christine and save Arnie is to destroy the car. Dennis scratches "Darnell's Tonight"—referencing the name of the junkyard—into Christine's hood, then makes his way there with Leigh. Dennis waits in a bulldozer while Leigh heads to the office so that she can shut the door after Christine arrives, trapping the car. Christine, who has been lying in wait the entire time, shines its headlights from under a pile of trash and charges after Leigh. Christine crashes into Darnell's office in an attempt to kill Leigh, and Arnie (revealed to have been driving the car himself) is thrown through Christine's windshield. He is impaled on a shard of glass and dies, reaching out to touch Christine one last time. Dennis and Leigh engage in a fight against Christine with the bulldozer. Christine continues to attack Dennis and Leigh, repeatedly sustaining damage and regenerating. Dennis pulls Leigh into the cab of the bulldozer; the two then smash Christine, driving back and forth over the car with the bulldozer as it mocks them by playing "Rock and Roll Is Here To Stay" over the radio until it is too damaged to immediately regenerate.</p>
				<p class="monster_p">Dennis, Leigh, and Junkins survive and leave behind the remains of the car. The closing shot of the film is of Christine, now crushed into a cube by a car crusher, as a piece of the grille slowly begins to move and "Bad to the Bone" plays. (End of Plot)</p>
				<p class="monster_p">Although the car in the film is identified as a 1958 Plymouth Fury—and in 1983 radio ads promoting the film, voiceover artists announced, "she's a '57 Fury"—two other Plymouth models, the Belvedere and the Savoy, were also used to portray the malevolent automobile onscreen. John Carpenter placed ads throughout Southern California searching for models of the car, and was able to purchase twenty-four of them in various states of disrepair, which were used to build a total of seventeen copies of the film car.</p>

				<p class="monster_p">Total production for the 1958 Plymouth Fury was only 5,303, and they were difficult to find and expensive to buy at the time. In addition, the real-life Furys only came in one color, "Buckskin Beige", seen on the other Furys on the assembly line during the initial scenes of the movie. The Fury also got anodized gold trim on the body and Fury script on the rear fender. In order to bypass the problem of obtaining the rare trim, the cars featured the more common Belvedere "Dartline" trim. Several vehicles were destroyed during filming, but most of the cars were Savoy and Belvedere models dressed to look like the Fury. At least one '57 Savoy was used, its front end modified to look like a '58.</p>
				<p class="monster_p">Originally, Carpenter had not planned to film the car's regeneration scenes, but decided after the shoot had finished to include them. The shots of the car regenerating itself were shot in post-production and done using hydraulics.</p>
				<p class="monster_p">Of the twenty cars used in the film, only two still exist. One is a stunt vehicle with a manual transmission and now resides in the hands of a private California collector. The other vehicle was rescued from a junkyard and restored by collector Bill Gibson of Pensacola, Florida.</p>
