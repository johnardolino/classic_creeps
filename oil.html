				<p class="monster_p"><strong>The Oil Slick</strong> is the antagonist of the short movie The Raft from Creepshow 2, a 1987 American live-action/animated comedy horror anthology film directed by Michael Gornick, and the sequel to Creepshow. Gornick was previously the cinematographer of the first film, and the screenplay was written by George A. Romero who was director of the original film. It was once again based upon stories by Stephen King, and features three horror segments consisting of Old Chief Wooden Head, The Raft and The Hitchhiker.</p>
				<p class="monster_p">We are focusing on The Raft. For now...</p>
				<p class="monster_p"><b><u>Plot:</u></b></p> 
				<p class="monster_p">Four college students, Deke, Laverne, Randy and Rachel, go swimming in a desolate lake far from civilization. After they make their way to a wooden raft, they are terrorized by a floating black blob resembling an oil slick that grabs a hold of Rachel and consumes her.</p>

				<p class="monster_p">Panicked, Deke plans to swim to shore so he can bring back help. Before he can, the blob seeps through the raft's cracks and pulls Deke through the raft, killing him. Randy and Laverne evade the creature until it gives up trying to grab them from under the raft. Randy and Laverne are afraid to fall asleep in fear that the creature will attack.</p> 
				<p class="monster_p">They manage to sleep and Randy is the first to wake up, relieved to find that he and Laverne made it through the night. He begins caressing Laverne's sleeping body and fondling her breasts. She awakes screaming in agony as the creature is revealed to have seeped through the cracks and has covered the right half of her face, much to Randy's horror. As the oil-like blob pulls her off the raft and begins consuming her, Randy jumps off to swim to shore. He ultimately makes it, barely escaping the creature, and yells "I beat you!" However, the creature rears up from the water like a wave and engulfs Randy. It returns to the lake, leaving no evidence of the four students ever having visited the lake, other than their still-running car. Unknown to the students, there was a "no swimming" sign barely visible behind some thick vegetation. (End of Plot)</p>

				<p class="monster_p">The Raft was a short story in Skeleton Crew, a collection of short fiction by American writer Stephen King, published by Putnam in June 1985. </p>
				<p class="monster_p"><b><u>Book Plot:</u></b></p>
				<p class="monster_p">Four college students named Randy, Deke, Rachel, and LaVerne decide to swim to a wooden raft on a remote Pennsylvania lake to celebrate the end of summer.</p>
				<p class="monster_p">While swimming out to the raft in the middle of the lake, Randy notices a mysterious oil slick-like substance floating on the surface that appears to go after the girls as they reach the raft. Deke and LaVerne ridicule Randy's suspicions that the oil slick was chasing the girls until Rachel remarks on the beautiful bands of colors on the slick's surface and touches it. The oil slick instantly coats her finger and pulls her into the water, where it covers her with itself and dissolves her alive. The horrified trio are helplessly forced to watch her die.</p> 
				<p class="monster_p">After the initial panic, the three remaining friends contemplate their next course of action. They realize they are trapped by what is apparently some unknown blob creature (similar to a slime mold) that is waiting to devour whoever enters the water. Swimming past the creature is not an option, as it moves too fast. The group has driven eight miles off the nearest back road without having told anyone where they were going, making rescue impossible. Their only hope is to wait and see if it goes away. The iridescent surface of the creature hypnotizes and disorients them into almost falling off the raft, but they realize that it can be avoided if you look away in enough time. After a while, the creature squeezes under the raft. Deke decides he could make a swim to the shore, but as he prepares to jump into the lake the creature oozes up through two boards and grabs him by his foot. Unable to free their friend, Randy and LaVerne watch helplessly as Deke is slowly pulled through the crack by the creature and devoured. LaVerne faints from the sight; Randy fights to maintain his sanity and contemplates swimming to shore while the creature is busy eating Deke, but finds he cannot do so, as laying her down would cause her to suffer the same fate as Deke.</p>
				<p class="monster_p">After LaVerne regains consciousness, Randy and LaVerne take turns watching the creature. They also take turns sitting and standing, allowing brief moments of rest for one while the other watches for when it goes under the raft. During the course of the night, LaVerne convinces Randy that they should sit and watch it together and keep each other warm. The two start having sex, and LaVerne's hair falls over the side of the raft. Before Randy can pull LaVerne up, the creature manages to tangle itself in her hair and flows over her head, melting her face. Unable to save LaVerne, he kicks her over the side of the raft in a panic, quickening her death.</p>

				<p class="monster_p">As morning comes, Randy fantasizes about rescue, suffering from extreme fatigue. Eventually, the creature begins to flow under the raft every time Randy tries to sit down, forcing him to remain permanently standing. Randy finally breaks down and gives up, acknowledging the hopelessness of the situation.</p>
				<p class="monster_p">After night comes, Randy turns to the creature and contemplates that the creature's colors will take the pain out of being consumed. Randy does not look away as the creature shimmers hues at him, and the story ends. (End of Book Plot)</p>
				<p class="monster_p">Yeah, pretty much the same, save for the ending. I needed filler. Someday I'll come back here and add my own thoughts.</p>
