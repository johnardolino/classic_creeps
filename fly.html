				<p class="monster_p"><strong>The Fly</strong> is a 1958 American science fiction-horror film produced and directed by Kurt Neumann and starring David Hedison, Patricia Owens, Vincent Price and Herbert Marshall. The screenplay by James Clavell was based on the 1957 short story of the same name by George Langelaan.</p>
				<p class="monster_p">The film tells the story of a scientist who is transformed into a grotesque creature after a common house fly enters unseen into a molecular transporter he is experimenting with, resulting in his atoms being combined with those of the insect, producing a human-fly hybrid. The film was released in CinemaScope with Color by Deluxe by 20th Century Fox.</p>
				<p class="monster_p">Producer-director Kurt Neumann discovered the story in Playboy magazine. He showed it to Robert L. Lippert, head of Fox's subsidiary B-movie studio Regal Pictures. The film would be made by Lippert's outfit but was released as an "official" Fox film, not under the less prestigious Regal banner.</p> 
				<p class="monster_p">Lippert hired James Clavell to adapt George Langelaan's short story on the strength of a previous sci-fi spec script at RKO which had never been produced. It would become Clavell's first filmed screenplay. Harry Spalding recalled the script was "the best first draft I ever saw, it needed very little work."</p>
				<img class="monster_img_two" src="https://orig00.deviantart.net/c273/f/2012/097/1/0/return_of_the_fly_10_by_farzelgaart-d4vbsli.gif" width="640" height="272" alt="The Fly gif"></a>
				<p class="monster_p">The adaptation remained largely faithful to Langelaan's story, apart from moving its setting from France to Canada, and crafting a happier ending by eliminating a suicide.</p> 
				<p class="monster_p">Lippert tried to cast Michael Rennie and Rick Jason in the role of André Delambre, before settling on then mostly-unknown David Hedison (billed as "Al Hedison" on-screen.) Hedison's "Fly" costume featured a twenty-pound fly's head, about which he said: "Trying to act in it was like trying to play the piano with boxing gloves on". Hedison was never happy with the makeup, but Makeup Director Ben Nye Sr. remained very positive about his work, writing years later that despite doing many subsequent science fiction films, "I never did anything as sophisticated or original as The Fly".</p>
				<p class="monster_p">The review continued with, "On the credit side, the camera very snugly frames the small town background — a store, a church spire, several homes and a theatre. The color is quite good (the blob rolls around in at least a dozen horrible-looking flavors, including raspberry). The acting is pretty terrible itself, there is not a single becomingly familiar face in the cast, headed by young Steven McQueen and Aneta Corseaut."</p>
				<img class="monster_img_three" src="https://i.pinimg.com/236x/69/2a/db/692adb62c6f8ef205e3dac60c0a7aaed--scary-monsters-classic-monsters.jpg" width="236" height="301" alt="Blob Movie Poster">
				<p class="monster_p">Years later, Vincent Price recalled the cast finding some levity during the filming: "We were playing this kind of philosophical scene, and every time that little voice [of the fly] would say ‘Help me! Help me!’ we would just scream with laughter. It was terrible. It took us about 20 takes to finally get it".</p>
				<p class="monster_p">The film's financial success had the side-effect of boosting co-star Vincent Price (whose previous filmography featured only scattered forays into genre film) into a major horror star. Price himself was positive about the film, saying, decades later, "I thought THE FLY was a wonderful film – entertaining and great fun."</p>
				<p class="monster_p">The Fly remake is a 1986 American science-fiction body horror film directed and co-written by David Cronenberg. Produced by Brooksfilms and distributed by 20th Century Fox, the film stars Jeff Goldblum, Geena Davis and John Getz. Loosely based on George Langelaan's 1957 short story of the same name, the film tells of an eccentric scientist who, after one of his experiments goes wrong, slowly turns into a fly-hybrid creature. The score was composed by Howard Shore and the make-up effects were created by Chris Walas, along with makeup artist Stephan Dupuis.</p>

				<p class="monster_p">The film was released on August 15, 1986 to massive acclaim by critics and audiences, with praise mainly regarding the special effects and Goldblum's performance. It grossed $60.6 million at the box office against its nine-million-dollar budget, becoming the largest commercial success of Cronenberg's career. Walas and Dupuis' work on the film resulted in their winning an Academy Award for Best Makeup, the only film directed by Cronenberg to win an Oscar. A sequel, directed by Walas, was released in 1989.</p>
