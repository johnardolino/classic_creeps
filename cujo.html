				<p class="monster_p"><strong>Cujo</strong> is a 1983 American horror film based on Stephen King's 1981 novel of the same name and directed by Lewis Teague. It was written by Don Carlos Dunaway and Barbara Turner (using the pen name Lauren Currier), and starring Dee Wallace, Daniel Hugh Kelly and Danny Pintauro. The film revolves around a rabid St. Bernard dog, who traps a mother and her child inside their car without food or water during a heat wave, and their attempts to survive.</p>
				<p class="monster_p">Despite receiving mixed reviews and being a modest success during its theatrical release, the film has gathered a major cult following in the years since its release. Another film adaptation was announced in 2015 and is currently in production.</p>
				<p class="monster_p"><b><u>Plot:</u></b></p> 
				<p class="monster_p">Cujo, a friendly and easygoing St. Bernard, chases a wild rabbit and inserts his head into a cave, where a rabid bat bites his nose. Meanwhile, the Trenton family – advertiser Vic (Daniel Hugh-Kelly), housewife Donna (Dee Wallace) and their sensitive young son Tad (Danny Pintauro) – take their car to the rural home of abusive mechanic Joe Camber (Ed Lauter) for some repairs, where they meet Cujo (the dog from the prologue), who is the Camber family's pet. Donna notices Cujo's bitten nose, but thinks little of it. Later, Vic and Donna's marriage is tested when Vic learns that Donna is having an affair with her ex-boyfriend from high school, Steve Kemp (Christopher Stone), while Vic's advertising for a cereal commercial is failing. Charity (Kaiulani Lee) and Brett (Billy Jacoby), Joe's wife and son leave the house for a week to visit Charity's sister Holly. When the bite infection drives Cujo mad, he kills their alcoholic neighbor, Gary Pervier (Mills Watson), and Joe (who is attacked before he can call authorities).</p>

				<p class="monster_p">Vic goes out of town on a business trip, as Donna and Tad return to the Camber's house for more car repairs. Cujo attacks them, and they take shelter in their Ford Pinto. Donna tries to drive home, but the car's alternator dies and the two are trapped inside. The hot sun makes conditions nearly unbearable, and Donna realizes that she must do something before they both die from heatstroke or dehydration. However, attempts at escape are foiled by Cujo's repeated attacks. Vic returns home to rekindle his marriage, only to find Donna and Tad missing and his house vandalized by Kemp. He suspects the possessive Kemp of kidnapping, but then realizes his wife and son might be at the Cambers' house.</p> 
				<p class="monster_p">The local sheriff, George Bannerman (Sandy Ward), arrives at the house and has a brief standoff, before Cujo kills him, knocking him off the catwalk in the barn and mauling him to death. Meanwhile, Donna takes advantage of a momentary distraction and hits Cujo with a baseball bat until it breaks, leaving only a jagged handle. Cujo jumps at her and is impaled in the stomach by the broken bat. Donna takes the sheriff's revolver and retrieves Tad, who is dehydrated and overheated. As Donna revives Tad in the house, Cujo, now recovered, breaks through the kitchen window and tries to kill them. However, Donna shoots Cujo dead, before Vic arrives and reunites with his family. (End of Plot)</p>

				<p class="monster_p">Cujo was a modest box office success for Warner Brothers. The film was released August 12, 1983 in the United States, opening in second place that weekend. It grossed a total of $21,156,152 domestically, making it the fourth highest grossing horror film of 1983 behind Jaws 3-D, Psycho II, and Twilight Zone: The Movie.</p>
				<p class="monster_p">On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 58% based on 31 reviews with an average rating of 5.6/10, the critical consensus stating "Cujo is artless work punctuated with moments of high canine gore and one wild Dee Wallace performance." On Metacritic, the film holds a 58/100 based on 8 critics, meaning “mixed or average reviews”. Author and film critic Leonard Maltin gave the film three out of a possible four stars, calling it "genuinely frightening" also writing, "Builds slowly but surely to [its] terrifying (but not gory) climax." Despite the mixed reception, Stephen King called the film "terrific" and named it one of his favorite adaptations.</p>
				<p class="monster_p">Cujo's name was based on the nom de guerre of Willie Wolfe, one of the men responsible for orchestrating Patty Hearst's kidnapping and indoctrination into the Symbionese Liberation Army. Stephen King discusses Cujo in On Writing, referring to it as a novel he "barely remembers writing at all". The book was written during a period when King was on a cocaine binge. King goes on to say that he likes the book and that he wishes he could remember enjoying the good parts as he put them down on the page.</p>

				<p class="monster_p">According to King, the novel was partly inspired by his trip to a mechanic during "the spring of 1977." In a 2006 interview with The Paris Review, King describes how issues with his motorcycle led him to visit an auto shop on the northern outskirts of Bridgton, Maine. He claims that his motorcycle died when he arrived at the shop, and moments after, a Saint Bernard emerged from the garage, growling at him and eventually lunging for his hand. Although the mechanic stopped the dog from harming King by hitting the dog’s hindquarters with a wrench, King was still startled by the encounter. This incident, as well as a story published in a Portland, Maine newspaper about a young child that was killed by a Saint Bernard served as inspirations for the novel. King also owned a dysfunctional Ford Pinto at the time, which is the same car model that the novel’s protagonist, Donna Trenton, drives to the auto garage where she encounters the rabid Cujo.</p>
