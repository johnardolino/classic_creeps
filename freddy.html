				<p class="monster_p"><strong>Frederick Charles "Freddy" Krueger</strong> (/ˈkruːɡər/) is a character from the A Nightmare on Elm Street film series. He first appeared in Wes Craven's A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984) as a burnt serial killer who uses a glove armed with razors to kill his victims in their dreams, causing their deaths in the real world as well. In the dream world, he is a powerful force and almost completely invulnerable. However, whenever Freddy is pulled into the real world, he has normal human vulnerabilities.</p>
				<p class="monster_p">Krueger was created by Wes Craven and had been consistently portrayed by Robert Englund since his first appearance. In the 2010 franchise reboot, he was portrayed by Jackie Earle Haley. In 2011, Freddy appeared as a playable character in the video game Mortal Kombat. Over the course of the series, Freddy has battled numerous survivors including Nancy Thompson.</p>
				<p class="monster_p">Freddy is a dream-demon who attacks his victims from within their dreams. He is commonly identified by his burned, disfigured face, red-and-green striped sweater, brown fedora, and trademark metal-clawed brown leather glove only on his right hand. This glove was the product of Krueger's own imagination, the blade having been welded by himself. Robert Englund has said many times that he feels the character represents neglect, particularly that suffered by children. The character also more broadly represents subconscious fears.</p> 
				<p class="monster_p">Wizard magazine rated Freddy the 14th greatest villain, the British television channel Sky2 listed him 8th, and the American Film Institute ranked him 40th on its "AFI's 100 Years...100 Heroes & Villains" list. In 2010, Freddy won an award for Best Villain (formerly Most Vile Villain) at the Scream Awards.</p>

				<p class="monster_p">A Nightmare on Elm Street is a 1984 American slasher film written and directed by Wes Craven, and produced by Robert Shaye. It stars Heather Langenkamp, John Saxon, Ronee Blakley, Amanda Wyss, Jsu Garcia, Robert Englund and Johnny Depp in his film debut. The plot focuses on four teenagers who are invaded and killed in their dreams, thus killed in reality, by a burnt killer with a bladed glove. The teenagers are unaware of the cause of this strange phenomenon, but their parents hold a dark secret from long ago.</p>
				<p class="monster_p"><b><u>Plot:</u></b></p> 
				<p class="monster_p">Tina Gray awakens from a nightmare wherein she is attacked by a disfigured man wearing a blade-fixed glove, and her mother points out four mysterious slashes on her nightgown. The following morning, she is consoled by her best friend, Nancy Thompson, and Nancy's boyfriend, Glen Lantz. The two stay at Tina's house following her mother going out of town, but their sleepover is interrupted by Tina's boyfriend, Rod Lane. When Tina falls asleep, she is chased by the man. Rod awakens to Tina's thrashing, and witnesses her being dragged and fatally slashed by an unseen force. He flees as Nancy and Glen awaken to find a bloodied Tina dead.</p>
				<p class="monster_p">The next day, Rod is arrested by Nancy's father, Lieutenant Don Thompson, despite his pleas of innocence. At school, Nancy falls asleep in class and the man, calling himself Freddy Krueger, chases her to the boiler room. When cornered, she burns her arm on a pipe and awakens, where she notices the burn mark on her arm. At home, Nancy falls asleep in the bathtub and is nearly drowned by Freddy. She goes to Rod at the police station, who tells her about what happened to Tina, and Nancy believes that Freddy is responsible for Tina's death.</p>

				<p class="monster_p">Nancy invites Glen to watch over her as she falls asleep. She sees Freddy preparing to kill Rod in his cell, but then turns his attention towards her. She runs away and wakes up when her alarm clock goes off. Freddy kills Rod when he wraps the bed sheets around his neck as a noose, and Nancy and Glen go to the cell to find his body hanging. At Rod's funeral, Nancy's parents become more worried when she describes Freddy in her dreams. Her mother, Marge, takes her to a dream clinic, where she manages to grab Freddy's hat and pull it from the dream into her possession.</p>
				<p class="monster_p">Marge begins to drink heavily and bars the windows at home. She tells Nancy that Freddy was a child murderer released on a technicality, and the parents burned him alive in a form of vigilante justice. Nancy realizes that Freddy desires revenge and she tries to call Glen to warn him, but his parents prevent her from speaking to him. Glen falls asleep and is killed by Freddy, and a large fountain of blood is released in his room. Now alone, Nancy puts Marge to sleep and asks Don, who is across the street investigating Glen's death, to break into the house in 20 minutes. She rigs booby traps around the house, and grabs Freddy out of the dream and into the real world. After Freddy suffers from the traps, she lights him on fire and locks him in the basement, before rushing to the door for help. As the police arrive to find Freddy has escaped from the basement, Nancy and Don go upstairs to see a burning Freddy smothering Marge in her bedroom. After Don puts out the fire, Freddy and Marge vanish into the bed.</p>
				<p class="monster_p">When Don leaves the room, Freddy rises from the bed behind Nancy. When she realizes that he is powered by his victim's fear, Nancy calmly turns her back on him and he evaporates when he attempts to lunge at her, defeating him. Nancy steps outside into a bright morning where all of her friends and mother are still alive. She gets into Glen's car to go to school where the top comes down and suddenly locks them in, and the car begins to drive uncontrollably down the street. As two girls playing jump rope are seen chanting Freddy's nursery rhyme, Marge is grabbed by Freddy through the front door window. (End of Plot)</p>

				<p class="monster_p">Wes Craven stated that part of the inspiration for Freddy's infamous bladed glove was from his cat, as he watched it claw the side of his couch one night.</p>
				<p class="monster_p">In an interview he said, "Part of it was an objective goal to make the character memorable, since it seems that every character that has been successful has had some kind of unique weapon, whether it be a chain saw or a machete, etc. I was also looking for a primal fear which is embedded in the subconscious of people of all cultures. One of those is the fear of teeth being broken, which I used in my first film. Another is the claw of an animal, like a saber-toothed tiger reaching with its tremendous hooks. I transposed this into a human hand. The original script had the blades being fishing knives."</p>
				<p class="monster_p">Freddy's glove appeared in the 1987 horror-comedy Evil Dead II above the door on the inside of a toolshed. This was Sam Raimi's response to Wes Craven showing footage of The Evil Dead in A Nightmare on Elm Street, which in turn was a response to Sam Raimi putting a poster of Craven's 1977 film The Hills Have Eyes in The Evil Dead. The glove also appears in the 1998 horror-comedy Bride of Chucky in an evidence locker room that also contains the remains of the film's villain Chucky, the chainsaw of Leatherface from The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and the masks of Michael Myers from Halloween and Jason Voorhees from Friday the 13th.</p>
